#### Summary

> Hi there! I’m a data analyst with experience managing marketing and inventory data for an ecommerce business.
I was responsible for demand forecasting, inventory management, pricing research, and supplier coordination before transitioning to a tech company, where my focus shifted to data warehousing, including data integration and the ETL process.
I’ve received in-house training in Python, supervised machine learning algorithms, and data visualization tools such as Power BI and Tableau.
